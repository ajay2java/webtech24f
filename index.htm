	<h2 id="about">About Ajay</h2>
	<p>
		My name is Ajay Subramanian, and I am from Solon, Ohio. 
		I am a current senior at <a href="http://www.babson.edu" target="_blank">Babson College</a>, concentrating in Business Analytics & Technology Entrepreneurship. 
		After graduation, I am looking to become a Product Manager or Data Analyst in the gaming industry. 
		In terms of my academic interests, I am interested in Machine Learning, and Entrepreneurship. 
		On top of taking Web Tech this semester, I'm also taking Len Green's class, so it's going to be an adventure to say the least!

	<p>
		My two main hobbies are playing chess and cooking. 
		I've been an active tournament chess player since I was 10 years old (I'm currently 21 years old). 
		Since I started, I've been able to become a Class A Player (Peak Rating: 1841) and win state championships with my high school team. 
		I enjoy chess due to the strategic nature of the game, and I hope to one day become a National Master. 
		As it pertains to cooking, I enjoy making american (e.g., burgers), italian (e.g., pasta), and indian (e.g., daal rice) recipies above all!
