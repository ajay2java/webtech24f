Moral of the story, you automatically fail if you don't try. I was scared to try Adobe Animate some months back, but I took the leap of faith, and look at how far I've come since. For anything in life, you can do whatever you put your mind to. NEVER let anyone tell you otherwise. There will be failures, but the most important thing is how you view those failures. For me, I see failures as an opportunity to improve! This mindset is best suited for longetivty. You always have to start somewhere to become great. So...are you still scared to try something hard?";
